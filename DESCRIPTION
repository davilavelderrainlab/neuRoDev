Description: neuRoDev package is an R package that provides analysis tools to use the integrated transcriptomic references of cortex development described in *DOI*. The functions allow the visualization and exploration of the expression of genes and genesets across cortical development in multiple cell types. Additionally, the package allows the mapping of both single-cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq datasets, as well as tools for their interpretation.

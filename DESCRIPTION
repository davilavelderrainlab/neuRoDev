Description: Starting from one or multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, the package clusters the cells and computes signatures of each cluster. Then, by correlation with a set of reference signatures, it constructs a correlation matrix which is plotted as a UMAP. The package then allows to add new, unlabelled data to the UMAP, by repeating the same steps and plotting the newly obtained clusters on the starting UMAP, and it quantifies the characteristics of the neighbours to label the new data. On the other hand, it also allows to get further information on the starting datasets if a new labelled one is added.
